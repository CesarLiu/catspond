"""Who caused a collision, by Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS;
Shalev-Shwartz, Shammah & Shashua, "On a Formal Model of Safe and Scalable
Self-driving Cars", arXiv:1708.06374): the rule-based baseline for the
counterfactual attribution of responsibility/blame.py.

RSS calls a time *dangerous* for two cars when they are closer than the safe
distance both longitudinally (Lemma 2: the rear car must be able to stop
behind a front car braking at up to brake_max, after a response time rho in
which it may still accelerate) and laterally (Lemma 4: after rho of lateral
acceleration toward each other and lateral braking, at least mu apart).
The *danger threshold* t_b is where the dangerous stretch that ends in the
collision began (Def. 9: the later of the longitudinal and the lateral
threshold). From t_b on both cars owe the *proper response* of the axis
that became dangerous last (Def. 10):

  longitudinal (Def. 4)  the rear car accelerates at most accel_max for rho,
                         then brakes at least brake_min until it stops; the
                         front car brakes at most brake_max
  lateral (Def. 8)       both accelerate laterally toward each other at most
                         lat_accel_max for rho, then brake laterally at least
                         lat_brake_min until their lateral velocity is 0

A car that did not comply is responsible: verdict "ego" / "other", "shared"
when neither complied, "n/a" when both did (the parameters did not
describe the collision) or RSS says nothing here. Both definitions constrain
speeds, and compliance is checked on them: from t_b on, a car's speed (on
the axis concerned, toward the other) may not exceed the envelope of its
proper response -- rising at most at the allowed acceleration for rho, then
falling at least at the owed braking to 0 -- nor the front car's fall below
braking at brake_max, up to a slack for the noise of estimated speeds.
Speeds rather than accelerations differenced from 10 Hz states, which are
far noisier.

Scope and approximations:
  * Same-direction pairs only (headings within 30 degrees before the
    collision): a multi-lane road with one geometry (paper Sec. 3.5), which
    covers rear-end, cut-in and side-swipe collisions. Oncoming and crossing
    collisions need the lane graph (which lane runs which way, which route
    has priority, Sec. 3.7) and get "n/a"; ``coverage`` in the comparisons
    says how many collisions that leaves.
  * The lane frame at every step is the direction of the nearest lane
    centreline (within 4 m of the two cars' midpoint, running their way
    within 45 degrees), so curves do not register as lateral motion and the
    frame does not turn with a car that leaves its lane; where no lane is
    near, the bisector of the two headings stands in. Longitudinal and
    lateral velocities are the logged (or simulated) velocities projected
    onto it.
  * When the cars were already dangerous at the first step both are seen,
    the true threshold lies before the clip; the first step stands in for
    it and both axes' responses apply (Def. 10 with t_long_b = t_lat_b).
    The case is then marked "/first-step".
  * One response time for both cars (the paper's; ad-rss-lib defaults to
    1 s for the ego and 2 s for others, which would judge the two sides by
    different standards). The other values are ad-rss-lib's defaults.
