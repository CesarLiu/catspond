"""Conditional value-at-risk (CVaR), used for safety responsibility (Eq. 3).

We use the standard Rockafellar & Uryasev convention where ``alpha`` is a
confidence level: CVaR_alpha(C) is the expected value of C in its upper
(1 - alpha) tail. This is the convention consistent with the paper's own
stated limit, "in the extreme case when alpha -> 1, the safety
responsibility is the maximum safety outcome decrease" (Sec III-B): as
alpha -> 1 the tail shrinks to a single point, the maximum. The in-text
formula in the paper (integrating VaR over gamma in [1-alpha, 1] and
dividing by alpha) is the mirror-image convention for a *lower*-tail loss
and does not itself reduce to that stated limit; we implement the
upper-tail convention so the code matches the paper's documented behavior
and its experiment (``alpha=0.1`` for safety responsibility, i.e. CVaR
close to the mean, only lightly emphasizing the tail).
