"""The lane graph of a scene's map, for telling an alternative's intent:
which lanes an agent's logged route runs along, and which goals lie on them.

WOMD / ScenarioNet lanes are short segments (in scene 0: 68 lanes, median
51 m) linked by ``entry_lanes`` / ``exit_lanes`` and side by side through
``left_neighbor`` / ``right_neighbor``. An agent's route is therefore a set
of lanes, not one: braking alternatives end on a lane segment the agent
passed earlier, faster ones on a successor.

  route_lanes      the lanes the agent's logged motion from step k on runs
                   along, their left and right neighbours (a lane change
                   keeps the intent), and the chain of exit lanes after the
                   last of them (all branches: where the agent goes after
                   the log ends is unknown), each with its neighbours, up to
                   ``beyond`` metres further. Each logged position is
                   matched to one lane: the closest centreline within
                   MATCH_RADIUS running within MATCH_ALIGN of the agent's
                   heading (distance plus HEADING_WEIGHT m per rad). A lane
                   counts once the agent has driven MIN_ALONG metres matched
                   to it (half its length if shorter): where a turn lane
                   branches off, it overlaps the straight one for a metre or
                   two, and a car going straight passes it there. The lane
                   it is on at step k always counts.
  reachable_lanes  every lane an agent at step k can reach: the lanes it is
                   on, then the chain of exit lanes up to ``reach`` metres,
                   each with its neighbours -- the support of its valid goals.
  near             which points lie within ``radius`` of a lane's centreline.

Neighbours are leaves: following neighbours of neighbours (and their exits)
would spread across a whole intersection of short lane segments. Both
route_lanes and reachable_lanes give None -- no restriction -- for an agent
the map does not cover: on no lane at step k or at its last logged
position, or less than MIN_ON_LANES of its logged positions from step k on
a lane (a parking lot, or a driveway, which CAT's WOMD v1.1 maps lack).
