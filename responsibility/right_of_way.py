"""Who had the right of way where two road users' paths met, and who failed
the duty it gave them: the traffic-law baseline for conflicts between
different paths (crossing, turning across, merging, changing lanes), which
RSS (responsibility/rss.py) and the rear-end rule (responsibility/blame.py)
leave undecided. The rules are those of the place the data comes from:
WOMD was recorded in US cities, and the California Vehicle Code (CVC)
stands in for US law.

Everything is read from a ``Scene``: the two trajectories, the lane graph
(responsibility/lanes.py), the traffic-light states and stop signs, so
logged scenes and scenes rebuilt from policy rollouts are judged alike.

Conflict. Each agent's path is its centre's logged (or simulated) track up
to the step judged (``at``: the collision), extended EXTEND metres straight
on along its last heading, because a collision ends a track before its
centre reaches the other's path. The conflict point P* is where the two
paths cross (the crossing nearest to the two agents at ``at``); paths that
converge without crossing (a merge, a completed lane change) meet where
one first comes within ``merge_gap`` of the other; paths that do neither
meet at their closest approach. The conflict zone of agent x is the stretch
of its own path within

    h_x = L_x / 2 + (W_o + W_x |cos(theta)|) / (2 sin(theta))       [m]

of P*, where its footprint (length L_x, width W_x) overlaps the other's
swept strip (width W_o) crossing its path at the angle theta, with
sin(theta) held at 0.5 or more so that shallow merges stay finite.

Priority. In WOMD a traffic light and a stop sign control the intersection
lane that starts at the stop line (a light's stop point is that lane's
first point; a stop sign stands ~5 m to its side). Each agent is followed
along the lane graph from CONTROL_REACH metres before P* (lane_sequence:
it keeps to its lane, then its exit lanes, and of two branches leaving one
stop line the one it took). Its control is the light of the controlled lane
it entered last, in the state it showed when the agent crossed that stop
line (CVC 21451-21453: the light at the stop line counts; entering on
yellow is lawful), or of the controlled exit lane ahead of it that passes
P*, in its last seen state, when it has not crossed the line yet; else a
stop sign on such a lane (or a sign the map gives no lanes for, at the
right kerb of its approach); else "unknown" when lights stand within
SIGNAL_RADIUS of P* (a signalised intersection whose light for this
movement was not observed); else "none". The holder of the right of way is
decided by the first rule that applies:

    following         the two were on one path from the start (one behind
                      the other): rear-end territory, no priority
    approach headings within SAME_DIRECTION (one road; signals and signs
    do not part them):
      lane-change       one moved into the other's lane from a neighbouring
                        lane: it yields (21658(a))
      merge             paths converging from different lanes: the first
                        on the lane they share goes first
      same-direction    otherwise: no priority (RSS's lateral case)
    driveway          one comes from off the mapped lanes (a driveway, a car
                      park): it yields to the one on the road (21804(a))
    oncoming          both go straight from opposite directions: passing
                      each other, no priority
    signal-unknown    either control is unknown: no priority
    red-light         one entered on red (or a red arrow), the other on
                      green, yellow or a green arrow: red yields (21453)
    both on green / yellow / arrow:
      protected-arrow   a green arrow over a circular light
      left-turn         one turns left (or makes a U-turn) across the other
                        coming from the opposite direction: the turner yields
                        (21801(a), 21451(a))
      first-in          the one that entered the intersection later yields to
                        the one lawfully within it (21451(a))
      simultaneous      neither: no priority
    mixed-control     a light against a stop sign or no control: no priority
    stop-sign         one faces a stop sign (or a flashing red, 21457), the
                      other no control: the stopped one yields (21802)
    all-way-stop/...  both face stop signs (or both turn on red):
      first-in          the first to arrive (within ARRIVE of its stop line)
                        goes first
      order-unknown     both were waiting when the clip began: no priority
      left-turn, yield-right   arrived within TIE seconds of each other:
                        left turns yield to oncoming traffic (21801(a)),
                        then yield to the vehicle on the right (21800(b))
    neither controlled:
      through-road      a T junction: the road that ends there yields to the
                        one that continues (21800(c)); a road continues when
                        its lane, or a neighbour, has an exit within TURN of
                        straight on
      left-turn         as above (21801(a))
      uncontrolled      otherwise no priority. With ``uncontrolled_order``
                        the CVC's order applies instead: first-in (21800(a))
                        then yield-right (21800(b)). It is off by default:
                        a junction the map shows no control for is mostly
                        controlled in reality by signs or lights WOMD lacks,
                        and over CAT's 500 logged scenes (below) the holder
                        these two rules name went first in 40% (of 15) and
                        25% (of 8) of the pairs, no better than chance

"Entered" is the step the agent crossed the stop line into the
intersection (the first controlled lane), or else began its run on the
lane P* lies on (for a merge, the lane the two share after it).

Duties, as Signal Temporal Logic (responsibility/stl.py) over the steps
both are seen, every predicate a signed distance in metres:

    in_C(x)       h_x - |s_x - s*_x|          x's footprint is in the zone
    cleared(x)    s_x - s*_x - h_x            x has passed it
    can_stop(x)   (s*_x - h_x - s_x) - (v_x rho + v_x^2 / (2 brake))
                  x could still stop before the zone after the response
                  time rho, braking at ``brake`` (RSS's rho and brake_min)
    enters(x)     in_C(x) and not prev in_C(x)

    yield(y, p)   G( enters(y) -> cleared(p) or can_stop(p) )
                  the yielder y enters the zone only when the holder p has
                  passed it or can still stop before it: "yield to vehicles
                  close enough to constitute an immediate hazard"
                  (21800-21802)
    avoid(x, z)   G( in_C(z) and can_stop(x) and not in_C(x)
                     -> (not in_C(x)) W (not in_C(z)) )
                  nobody drives into a zone the other occupies while it
                  can still stop before it (21451(a): yield to vehicles
                  lawfully within the intersection), right of way or not

The yielder owes yield and avoid, the holder avoid; without a holder both
owe avoid only. An agent inside the zone when the two are first seen
entered it before then: its entry is not judged. A violated duty (negative
robustness) puts the collision on that agent: "ego", "other", "shared" when
both failed, "n/a" when neither did (".../no-violation"; e.g. a yielder
that entered lawfully and was hit downstream of the zone, which is a
rear-end collision) or no conflict was found. Robustness of an
event-triggered formula is bounded by how sharply the event is observed
(one 10 Hz step), so only its sign is the verdict; ``yield_gap`` gives the
holder's can_stop margin when the yielder entered, the informative number.

Checked on CAT's 500 logged scenes, the self-driving car against the other
object of interest at their closest approach (logged drivers mostly keep
the right of way, so its holder should usually pass P* first): of 220
pairs whose paths cross or merge and where one passed P* at least 0.5 s
before the other, 118 get a holder, and the holder passed first in 87%
(stop-sign 94% of 49, through-road 68% of 19, all-way-stop/first-in 100%
of 16, driveway 100% of 10, red-light 88% of 8, left-turn 100% of 7).
Most disagreements are a yielder that went first lawfully, the holder
still far away; the rest are left without a holder (signal-unknown 38,
uncontrolled 23, all-way-stop/order-unknown 17, same-direction 15,
oncoming 9). On those logged pairs the yield duty fails for 3% of the
yielders (4 of 117 where one entered the zone): the false-alarm rate of
the duties on lawful driving. It fails as rarely for the holders, had they
been the yielders (4%): logged conflicts are seldom close enough for the
duty to tell the two apart, so this checks the duties, not the priority.

Approximations: WOMD has no yield signs, so a yield-controlled approach
counts as uncontrolled; roundabouts and lane drops have no rule of their
own (a roundabout's entry can come out as through-road the wrong way
round); lane changes are read from the lane matching, which also jitters
between parallel turn lanes.
